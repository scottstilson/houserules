- No one may argue about shotgun, which can only be called when both contestants are outside.

**Specific to Sullivan**

- Sullivan may not be on his computer:
    - before breakfast,
    - if he has any responsibilities he hasnâ€™t discharged, and
    - after 9:30 PM. (Currently, this is actually set to 9:15 PM until he can cut himself off successfully two nights in a row at 9:15 PM.)
- He must come on a walk with Mom or Dad anytime she or he calls you.
